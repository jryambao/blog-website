                    <p>Let's take a look back to their rivalry that started on 2019. MSI 2019, T1 were one of the
                        favorites to win the tournament however they failed to
                        capture the trophy since they lost to G2 in the semi finals matchup. In Worlds 2019, they got
                        match up again with G2 in the semi finals and once again,
                        they failed to defeat the European team. Now in MSI 2022, with a whole new different team, T1
                        and G2 will go up against each other rekindling the old rivalry That
                        once started in 2019.
                    </p>
                    <p>T1 in 2022 seems a different beast than in 2019, going undefeated in their LCK spring split with
                        a record of 20-0 including the LCK finals.
                        All of T1 players are mechanically monster, they all excel at their own roles and is considered
                        already one of the best going throughout the year even though they haven't
                        played one whole year yet. G2 on the other hand rebuilt their team, keeping only two players
                        which is Caps and Jankos after having a dissapointing 2021 year which also is touted as
                        a super team.
                    </p>
                    <p>The matchup to watch for this series would be the midlane. Faker and Caps going against each
                        other once again, two of the best mid laner to do it.
                        Faker who is considered the greatest of all time versus Caps who is considered the best western
                        mid laner of all time. The last time they met was in the Rumble stage and
                        T1 managed to win against G2 by baiting them into going to the baron pit, T1 had problems
                        setting up the baron during the tournament and they've lost a considerable amount of games due
                        to them flipping the baron. Little did G2 know, T1 had set a trap for them and killing all of
                        their players and ending the game in 21 minutes.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">T1 looking themselves once again</h2>
                    <p>After losing to Evil Geniuses, T1 seems to have woken up to their fears and nervousnes and has been looking dominant once again.
                        T1 in the early part of Rumble stage seems to be a lot weaker than their Spring run in the LCK, making bad decisions one after the other and losing games
                        because of bad calls. But after losing to Evil Geniuses, they seem to have learned a lot from this lost. I am hoping to see the best of T1 going up against G2 in their
                        semi finals matchup.
